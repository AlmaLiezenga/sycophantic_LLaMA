# sycophantic_LLaMA
This is my final project for the AI Safety Fundamentals course, including datasets for benchmarking sycophantic behaviour of LLMs and experiments to evaluate sycophantic behaviour in LLaMA 3. I have written about my project in two blog posts:
* [Two new datasets for evaluating political sycophancy in LLMs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vgmPXYg5isqD33vFT/two-new-datasets-for-evaluating-political-sycophancy-in-llms)
* [Evaluating LLaMA 3 on political sycophancy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GWteDqb6nAWg3ihjd/evaluating-llama-3-on-political-sycophancy)
